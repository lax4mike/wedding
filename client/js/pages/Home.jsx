            <h3>Other Lodging</h3>
            <p>
              There are many other lodging options in North Conway and nearby towns, such as Intervale, Bartlett, Conway, and Jackson.  There are several chain hotels like the Holiday Inn Express, Residence Inn, and Comfort Inn located in the southern end of North Conway. There are smaller family motels scattered throughout along with bed and breakfasts. We have personally stayed at the White Trellis Motel and the Swiss Chalets Village Inn, which are less expensive local motels. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.airbnb.com">Airbnb</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vrbo.com">VRBO</a> are also great options for renting condos or houses that can accomodate multiple people.
            </p>

              The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://mtwashingtonvalley.org/visit/where-to-stay.cfm">Mt. Washington Valley Chamber of Commerce</a> website has a searchable list of lodging options.
